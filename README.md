# Forum on the Fly

A small project written by myself and a friend.

The backend is written here by me in PHP and the Slim framework.

The frontend design and css was written by a friend and is available to see with the deployed code on Heroku.

You can find this project here: [forumonthefly.herokuapp.com](http://forumonthefly.herokuapp.com)
